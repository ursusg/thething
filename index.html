                Hey, what's up? I'm Ursus and I honestly
                don't know what to say about myself. I currently work
                as a freelance photographer. I've been taking photos for about
                6 or 7 years now. I love photography and it started out as a hobby 
                of mine when I was in highschool. It began with an ASM (After School Matters)
                program that taught students how to develop rolls of film and then 
                develop prints inside of a darkroom. A print in the darkroom 
                honestly made me more excited about photography than I've ever felt.

                Other than photography, I tend to play a ton of video games and play the guitar.
                Right now, I mainly play Rocket League which is a car/soccer game. You drive around
                and have a rocket attached the back of the car. It allows for aerial movements and makes the 
                game have the best first person perspective of being a player on a field. I've been playing
                for over a year or two at this point.

                Oh, and I try to play my guitar as much as possible. I tried taking classes
                but found it way more engaging to learn on my own from Youtube videos or just from
                user-made tabs I found online. I understand having a foundation through classes
                makes for a better guitarist but I've always seen it as a hobby and less a career.
